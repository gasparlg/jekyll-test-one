### Opportunities and disadvantages

In the case of Brexit being victorious tomorrow, the economic status quo that the UK has maintained for quite some time will change, and along changes there are misfortunes and opportunities. Apart from describing the current pre-referendum situation, I will analyze who the winners and losers would be in the case of a breakup.

Currently, the wine and spirits industry in the UK represents almost 600.000 jobs and is cashing in £45bn annually. From those earnings, £1.8bn derive from exports to countries of the European Union. While based on the 2016 ‘Wine and Spirit Trade Association’ (WSTA) Annual Wine Report, EU imports of still wine represent 68% of all on-trade imports and 37% of all off-trade imports.

In terms of exchange rates the current situation of the Sterling is not helping the British economy. The Pound in relation to the Euro has weakened by an 8% in the last 6 months, and the pre-referendum scenario is making it even weaker. With the current exchange rate, being inside or outside the EU will not change the higher consumer prices for British consumers and a negative impact on the industry.

In the case of a breakup, long negotiations will begin between the UK and the EU. The results of these years-long negotiations can vary, but it is expected that tariffs as high as 32% would be applied to EU products.

In 2013, the House of Commons Library, presented the report ‘The Economic Impact of EU Membership on the UK’, where it expressed:

>“Because the UK has negotiated as part of the EU at the World Trade Organization, it is likely that it would inherit the EU’s tariff regime at the time of leaving, meaning, at least initially, higher prices would be faced by consumers buying imports from the EU and those countries with which the EU has trade agreements. Without any change, a 32% tariff would be levied on imports of wine, for instance.”

The impact of Brexit in the British Wine Producers would be mixed. In one side, the producers who are mostly focused on the internal market would certainly be benefited in a short and medium term. While on the other side, the producers that currently count on the EU for part of their sales would be affected on their profitability and growth plans. In both cases, the cost of production would rise in terms of labor and machinery costs.

In the other side of the coin, producing countries whose trade regulations won’t change after a possible Brexit would be benefited. New world wine countries like South Africa and Argentina would be more competitive at the moment of gaining new British consumers. The depreciation of the South African Rand and the Argentine Peso against the Sterling would be an added advantage in the market. In the last 6 months, the argentine peso has gone further out from the Sterling, going from 14 to 20 ARS per GBP. This would certainly help the flagships Malbec, Torrontes and Bonarda gain extra terrain in the UK.

Britain, in addition to being a distribution center for the domestically consumed wine, also works as one for the EU market. Many international wine producing companies often choose the UK as a hub for bottling, labeling and distributing their wines in Europe. A possible Brexit might cause the UK to lose attraction as a major global distribution center.

WSTA has warned last month after an internal poll that the industry is at risk in case of an exit of the European single market. This poll produced by the industry association along their more than 300 members has clearly shown that the wine industry sees the UK in a better position by being part of the EU. In percentages, 90% of its members stated that Britain would be stronger choosing ‘No’ for Brexit, 8% did not comment, and only 2% expect the UK in a better shape outside the union.

In a visit to Europe’s biggest bottling plant in Britain, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Damian Hinds said:

>“If the UK votes to leave the EU then the loss of access to the Single Market will result in a profound economic shock that will make this country permanently poorer. So, the message is clear, leaving the EU could drain investment away from the UK.”

UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who invited the WSTA to present their views on the possible exit from the EU, expressed:

>“Britain will be stronger, safer and better off in a reformed Europe than out on our own, because we will have full participation in the free trade area, bringing jobs, investment, lower prices and financial security. That means real certainty so you can plan for the future.”

The future of Britain after a possible Brexit seems far for clear based on a report carried out by Capital Economics. The research company found contradictory outcomes from different institutions. While some claim a 10% raise in the British GDP, others claim a reduction of 10%.

Major industry companies like Diageo, Pernod Ricard, and SABMiller signed a letter against Brexit expressing the following:

>“Businesses needs unrestricted access to the European market of 500 million people in order to continue to grow, invest and create jobs. We believe that leaving the EU would deter investment, threaten jobs and put the economy at risk. Britain will be stronger, safer and better off remaining a member of the EU.”

While some effects of the Brexit can be predicted in advance, the final impacts on the global wine industry can fluctuate and it would take at least a few years to clearly recognize the new economic situation for the different parties of the industry.
