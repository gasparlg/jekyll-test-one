After the unexpected results of last week’s British referendum, the business media has categorized this situation as a commercial crisis for the United Kingdom and the European Union, as well as for the global markets.

Just three days after Brexit, there is only uncertainty in the air and nobody knows with certitude the effects that this situation will bring. In occasions like this, experts use speculations and possible scenarios to try to anticipate future consequences, so my thesis for this article is based on the hypothetical case that the British economy won’t go into a recession, maintaining their GDP without major changes, and that the import tariffs negotiated with the European Union would be similar to the ones from other exporting countries.

The word ‘crisis’ in Chinese is composed of two characters — 危机 — one means danger and the other opportunity. While negative circumstances usually dazzle business people, there are opportunities in every economic crisis, with winners and losers. We can agree that the ones who lose the most in this situation are the UK and the EU, along all the foreign markets that have strong commercial relationships with the UK. These circumstances create economic uncertainty, which in turn, creates an economic slowdown that affects everyone in a short term.

### Opportunities for some countries

For many countries outside of the EU, the import tariffs won’t change, while for others the commercial relationships would have to be renegotiated. This situation, compared to the one of the EU, presents opportunities in a medium and long term. However, first is necessary to understand the current commercial situation of the UK.

In average 52.5% of British wine imports come from the European Union, while the rest, 47.5% of imports, come from other wine producing countries. These percentages are understandable since until the past June 23rd (and while negotiations continue), wines from the EU had a competitive advantage. The benefit they had is that producing countries like Spain, France, and Italy had the characteristic free trade between member states of the European Common Market. This situation made wines from other countries without special commercial arrangements less competitive from an economic standpoint.

Following this breakup, wines originated in the European Union would be treated (supposedly) in a similar way than wines from other countries. This will generate a more balanced competition, which means that some of the cost of importing Italian Sangiovese or Prosseco, would be very similar than importing Argentine Malbec or Bonarda.

Currently, EU wineries, having a 99.9% share of the British market, are in a risky situation and have a lot to lose. In the other side, wineries from around the world have a lot to gain, and they should analyze the current situation and invest in commercial campaigns to win over future debilitated shelf spaces, until today occupied by European wines.

For these wineries it would be necessary to follow closely the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and plan for an enlarged market share with more economically competitive wines. Also, it would be fundamental to pay close attention to the condition of the British economy, and maintain contact with importers, distributors, and retailers to be among the first ones to dispute for bigger sales in a competitive global market that continues in constant change.

I focus on the international business side of the wine industry. I spend my time meeting stakeholders from all the different areas of the trade and I write for publications like ARN Diario and Altman & Berg.
